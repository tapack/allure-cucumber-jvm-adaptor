Feature: Display failed scenarios in report as tests

  Report should display results according to mapping bellow.

  Mapping:
  - Failed Step -> Allure - step failed, rest steps in scenario is canceled, test is failed
  - Error in Step -> Allure - step broken, rest steps in scenario is canceled, test is broken
  - Step is undefined -> Allure - step pending, rest steps in scenario is canceled, test is pending

  Scenario: Calculate sum once and fail
    Given the first number 2
    And the second number 2
    When I add them together
    Then the sum is equal to 5

  Scenario Outline: Calculate sum of two digits and fail
    Given the first number <first>
    And the second number <second>
    When I add them together
    Then the sum is equal to <result>
    Examples:
      | first | second | result |
      | 1     | 2      | 3      |
      | 4     | 5      | 7      |
      | 5     | 5      | 10     |

  Scenario: Check number and throw Error
    Given the first number 2
    And the wrong number 2
    When I add them together
    Then the sum is equal to 4

  Scenario: Check number with undefined steps
    Given the first number 2
    And the non-existing number N
    When I add them together
    Then the sum is equal to 4

  Scenario: Calculate sum once again right
    Given the first number 2
    And the second number 2
    When I add them together
    Then the sum is equal to 4
